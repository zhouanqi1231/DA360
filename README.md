# Preparation

### Installation

Create the environment

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yaml
conda activate da360
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


# Evaluation

### Download the pre-trained models
```
bash scripts/download_models.sh
```

The pretrained models are available on [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1FMLWZfJ_IPKOa_cEbVqrq8_BRkl3oB_2?usp=drive_link) and can be downloaded mamanually. 


### Test On Panoramic Images  

Put the panoramic images in *./data/images* first then run the following command. There are six examples already. 
```
python test.py  --model_path ./checkpoints/DA360_large.pth --model_name DA360_large
```
The results would lie in *./checkpoints/DA360_large/results/*. 

### Perfom Evaluation
```
bash scripts/evaluate.sh
```
